1
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,603
Many people live in cities because there are

2
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,938
more jobs, schools and opportunities.

3
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,840
But life in the city is fast-paced

4
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,275
and busy.

5
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,794
Cities are full of offices, shops, tall buildings

6
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,579
and sometimes even skyscrapers 

7
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,532
like in New York, Seoul or Dubai

8
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,534
The streets are often crowded with people and

9
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,653
there is usually a lot of traffic.

10
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,155
To travel around, people often use public transport

11
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,875
like buses, trains or trams.

12
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,344
In London, for example, many people take the

13
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:32,395
underground.

14
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,630
In Melbourne, the trams are famous.

15
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:37,367
But some people prefer to drive or cycle

16
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,302
like in Amsterdam.

17
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,738
During peak time or rush hour, public transport

18
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,440
is very full and the roads are congested.

19
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,893
This often causes traffic jams.

20
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,295
However, in the city, you can find almost

21
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:50,480
anything.

22
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,165
There are supermarkets, cafes

23
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:53,366
and restaurants with food

24
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:55,385
from many different countries.

25
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,687
In Paris, there are cafes on almost every

26
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:58,421
corner.

27
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:00,440
And in Bangkok, you can eat street food

28
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,708
at night markets.

29
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:04,293
There are also bars, clubs, museums

30
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,895
and art galleries.

31
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,947
But it's not only shops and traffic.

32
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:10,299
Cities also have parks and green spaces, like

33
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,318
Central Park in New York or Hyde Park

34
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:15,388
in London, where people can relax, exercise or

35
01:01:15,388 --> 01:01:16,723
meet friends.

36
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:19,258
There are also many cultural events like concerts,

37
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,244
football matches and festivals.

38
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,213
In Rio de Janeiro, people celebrate Carnival.

39
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,132
In Berlin, there are music festivals

40
01:01:26,132 --> 01:01:27,266
all year round.

41
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,935
There is always something to do.

42
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,920
On the other hand, life in the city

43
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,271
can be stressful.

44
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,040
There is often a lot of noise, pollution

45
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,692
and heavy traffic.

46
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,844
So, city life is exciting and full of

47
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:40,063
choice, but it also has problems.

48
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,013
What about you?
