00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.003
Many people live in cities because there are

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.338
more jobs, schools and opportunities.

3
00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.240
But life in the city is fast-paced

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.675
and busy.

5
00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.194
Cities are full of offices, shops, tall buildings

6
00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:12.979
and sometimes even skyscrapers 

7
00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.932
like in New York, Seoul or Dubai

8
00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.934
The streets are often crowded with people and

9
00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.053
there is usually a lot of traffic.

10
00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.555
To travel around, people often use public transport

11
00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.275
like buses, trains or trams.

12
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.744
In London, for example, many people take the

13
00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:28.795
underground.

14
00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.030
In Melbourne, the trams are famous.

15
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.767
But some people prefer to drive or cycle

16
00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.702
like in Amsterdam.

17
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.138
During peak time or rush hour, public transport

18
00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.840
is very full and the roads are congested.

19
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.293
This often causes traffic jams.

20
00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.695
However, in the city, you can find almost

21
00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:46.880
anything.

22
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.565
There are supermarkets, cafes

23
00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:49.766
and restaurants with food

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.785
from many different countries.

25
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.087
In Paris, there are cafes on almost every

26
00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:54.821
corner.

27
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.840
And in Bangkok, you can eat street food

28
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.108
at night markets.

29
00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.693
There are also bars, clubs, museums

30
00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.295
and art galleries.

31
00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.347
But it's not only shops and traffic.

32
00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:06.699
Cities also have parks and green spaces, like

33
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.718
Central Park in New York or Hyde Park

34
00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:11.788
in London, where people can relax, exercise or

35
00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:13.123
meet friends.

36
00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.658
There are also many cultural events like concerts,

37
00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.644
football matches and festivals.

38
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.613
In Rio de Janeiro, people celebrate Carnival.

39
00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.532
In Berlin, there are music festivals

40
00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:23.666
all year round.

41
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.335
There is always something to do.

42
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.320
On the other hand, life in the city

43
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.671
can be stressful.

44
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.440
There is often a lot of noise, pollution

45
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.091
and heavy traffic.

46
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.244
So, city life is exciting and full of

47
00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:36.463
choice, but it also has problems.

48
00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.413
What about you?
