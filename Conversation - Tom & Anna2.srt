1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,290
Tom, is that you?

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,110
I haven't seen you in ages.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,530
Anna, wow, it's great to see you.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,730
How have you been?

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,970
I've been good.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,830
I've been at the university for six months now

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,710
What about you?

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,350
Are you a student here?

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,430
No, actually, I've worked here since 2023.

10
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,550
I didn't know you were a student here.

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,970
Yeah, I moved to the city last year.

12
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,690
How long have you lived here?

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,510
I've lived in the city for about five

14
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,330
years now.

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,370
I moved here in 2020.

16
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,890
It's been very busy, but I've really enjoyed

17
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,970
it so far.

18
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,610
I agree.

19
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,330
The city is very chaotic, but I've also

20
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,530
found lots of great cafes, museums and art

21
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:41,790
galleries.

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,530
That's awesome.

23
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,550
There are heaps of opportunities here, and I've

24
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,770
met so many interesting people in the city.

25
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,530
I've made some really good friends here, actually.

26
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:49,770
I'm so happy for you.

27
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,390
We should catch up sometime.

28
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,610
I'd love that.

29
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,830
What time suits you best?

30
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,730
Midday is the best for me.

31
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,790
That way I can avoid commuting during rush

32
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,450
hour.

33
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,850
Works for me.

34
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,270
I'll text you next week and we can

35
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,030
organise a coffee or something.

36
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,950
Awesome.

37
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,850
I'm happy we've met again after so long.

38
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,910
Me too.

39
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,350
Anyway, I have to run.

40
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,150
Talk to you next week.

41
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,790
OK.

42
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,330
Bye, Tom.
